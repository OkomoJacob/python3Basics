Defines a structure for our applications

wsgi: 
	Web server get interface- to provide a statd interface to those websites/ apps bulit in Django

Django organizes your project into multiple django apps
The moment you craete new views and urls, the beautiful default django homepage disappers.
2. Models: 
	A representation of real world concepts e.g in a jumia shop we  have models like:
		Orders
		customers, 
		reviews, 
		shopping carts, 
		deliveries etc

we'll modify Models eg by craetions, deletions etc	

3. Python manage.py makemigrations: use db.sqlite3 to create and manage your databases in your migrations
Python3 manage.py migrate: To allow django to run through all pending migrations(dbs) and make any neccessary apps

4. Admin: By default django admin is installed but with no user. So craete the first super user as below;
	python manage.py createsuperuser
5. Customizing Admin area:
	 in the admin.py, create a new class called e.g class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin)
to add our offers and prdcts in the admin area, we edit the admin.py

6. Templates:import the prdcts class from the models to create custom html views
	{% %} Template tag: To dynamically execute logic e.g for loops and if stsmnts to dynamically render content
	{{  }}: Double template tags to dynamically render values in our html markup.
7.Adding bootstrap:
